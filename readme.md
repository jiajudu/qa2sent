# QA2Sent

This is a tool for converting question-answer pair to a declarative sentence. For example, it converts

```
Q: What is the current series where the new series began in June 2011?
A: 'CB路06路ZZ'
```

to

```
CB路06路ZZ is the current series where the new series began in June 2011.
```

To see how to use this tool, run `python qa2sent.py` and modify its inputs and outputs.

Most of the codes come from (robinjia/adversarial-squad)[https://github.com/robinjia/adversarial-squad).
